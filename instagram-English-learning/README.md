# Learn English with Ctrl+E

**Learn English with Ctrl+E** is a project designed to automate the download of educational posts from an account that teaches English using movie clips. Enhance your language learning experience by setting up a custom keyboard shortcut to play these videos randomly whenever you need a quick study break.

## Features

- **Automated Downloads**: The script downloads all available posts. If your internet connection drops or the process is interrupted, simply run the script again to resume downloading from where it left off.
- **Seamless Video Playback**: The `randomPlay.sh` script can be moved to `/usr/bin` and made executable with `chmod +x randomPlay.sh`. This allows you to set a custom keyboard shortcut for quick access.
- **Custom Keyboard Shortcut**: Create a shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+E) via your system settings. Navigate to `Settings -> Keyboard -> View and Customize Shortcuts -> Customize Shortcuts` and assign the command `randomPlay.sh` to your desired key combination.

## Usage

Once your shortcut is set up, pressing `Ctrl+E` will launch a random video in VLC media player. This method makes learning English engaging and convenient, fitting easily into your daily routine.
